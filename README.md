# Sapphire Multi-Account Guide

Refer to this guide when multi-accounting or evading a ban on osu!

### **Sign out and clear cookies**: 
> 1) Ensure you're logged out of osu! on **all** platforms (in-game/browser).
> 2) Clear your browser's cookies **completely** (all browsers).

**Important**: Always repeat **#1 and #2** when switching accounts!

### **Utilize a VPN**:
> - **Cloudflare WARP** or **ProtonVPN** (Free) is a solid choice.
> - Stick to **one server** for a consistent IP address.
> - Ideally, you should use a paid VPN service with residential IPs such as **Kaspersky VPN** or **Mysterium VPN**.

### **Delete osu!auth log file**:
> - Delete **osu!auth.log** from your osu! folder located in the "Logs" folder in your osu! path

### **Inject Sapphire**:
> - While your game is closed, run the sapphire loader (https://sapphire.ac/download), click "Load Cheat" and start your osu!

### **Create spoofer profile**:
> 1) Once sapphire is loaded, head to the **Spoofer** tab in the menu.
> 2) Name the profile and then click **Generate**. This will generate a unique profile that you can now use to look like a completely different computer to osu!
> 3) Select the profile in the menu and click "Load". This will now queue the profile to be loaded upon next injection.
> 4) **Important**: After clicking OK on the message box that pops up, **close your game and re-inject the cheat** to apply the profile!
> * **Note**: You will know the profile has loaded once you see the notification pop up saying **"Loaded spoof profile**: (name)" upon re-injection.

### **Account Creation**:
> - Register a new osu! account
> - Follow our guide below on how to gain pp in a legitimate manner:

# PP (Performance Points) Guidelines:
* **Day 1**: **Max 20pp** per play | **Max 300pp** total.
* **Day 3**: **Max 35pp** per play | **Max 300pp** total.
* **Week 2**: **Max 85pp** per play | **Max 350pp** total.
* **Week 3+**: Gain pp gradually | **Max 400pp** total.

# Final notes and gameplay tips:
* Before setting significant plays, increase playcount by a large factor in order to make your vast increase in skill less suspicious.
* Avoid blatant settings to prevent manual bans.
* Make sure to switch spoofer profiles when logging into other accounts.
* Under **no circumstance** use any cheats **other** than sapphire.
* When disabling mods, submit plays wisely based on play count:
> * Hidden = 5-10+ plays before submitting
> * Flashlight: 20-25+ plays before submitting
